### Model MLCube

The `medperf_tutorial/model_mobilenetv2/` is a toy [Model MLCube](../../../mlcubes/mlcube_models.md). Once you submit your model to the benchmark, all participating Data Owners would be able to run the model within the benchmark pipeline. Therefore, your MLCube must support the specific input/output formats defined by the Benchmark Owners.

For the purposes of this tutorial, you will work with a pre-prepared toy benchmark. In a real-world scenario,  you should refer to your Benchmark Owner to get a format specifications and details for your practical case.
