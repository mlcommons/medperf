# User Roles and Responsibilities

There are different types of users/roles that can be created in MedPerf:

## Benchmark Committee

Include regulatory bodies, groups of experts (e.g., clinicians, patient representative groups), and data or Model Owners wishing to drive the evaluation of their model or data. Benchmark Committee do not have admin privileges on the system, but they have elevated permissions regarding the benchmark they define, such as deciding which model and Data Providers will participate.

## Platform Providers
