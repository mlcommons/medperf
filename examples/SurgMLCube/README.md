# SurgMLCube

Benchmarking machine learning models on surgical videos.

This Folder contains three MLCubes:

### surg_prep

A data preparation MLCube of surgical videos datasets annotated with surgical phases. More information is available [here](surg_prep/README.md)


### surg_model_TeCNO

A model MLCube for running inference on surgical videos datasets for the task of surgical phase recognition using [TeCNO](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59716-0_33) model. More information is available [here](surg_model_TeCNO/README.md).

### surg_metrics

A metrics MLCube for evaluating Frame-wise video classification models. More information is available [here](surg_metrics/README.md).
