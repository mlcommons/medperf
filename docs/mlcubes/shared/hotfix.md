!!! info "What is the `hotfix` function inside `mlcube.py`?"

    To summarize, this issue is benign and can be safely ignored. It prevents a potential issue with the CLI and does not require further action.

    If you use the `typer`/`click` library for your command-line interface (CLI) and have only one `@app.command`, the command line may not be parsed as expected by mlcube. This is due to a known issue that can be resolved by adding more than one task to the mlcube interface.
   
    To avoid a potential issue with the CLI, we add a dummy typer command to our model cubes that only have one task. If you're not using `typer`/`click`, you don't need this dummy command.
