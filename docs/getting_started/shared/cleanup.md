## Cleanup (Optional)

You have reached the end of the tutorial! If you are planning to rerun any of the tutorials, don't forget to cleanup:

- To shut down the local MedPerf server: press `CTRL`+`C` in the terminal where the server is running.

- To cleanup the downloaded files workspace, local MedPerf server database and local test storage, run the following script (make sure you are in the MedPerf's root directory):

```bash
sh tutorials_scripts/tutorials_cleanup.sh
```
