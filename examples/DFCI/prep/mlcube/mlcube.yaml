tasks:
  prepare:
  # This task is in charge of transforming the input data into the format
  # expected by the model cubes. 
    parameters:
      inputs: {
        data_path: images/,            # Required. Value must point to a directory containing the raw data inside workspace
        labels_path: labels/,         # Required. Value must point to a directory containing labels for the data
        parameters_file: parameters.yaml # Required. Value must be `parameters.yaml`
      }
      outputs: {
        output_path: data/               # Required. Indicates where to store the transformed data. Must contain transformed data and labels
      }
  sanity_check:
  # This task ensures that the previously transformed data was transformed correctly.
  # It runs a set of tests that check que quality of the data. The rigurosity of those
  # tests is determined by the cube author.
    parameters:
      inputs: {
        data_path: data/,                # Required. Value should be the output of the prepare task
        parameters_file: parameters.yaml # Required. Value must be `parameters.yaml`
      }
  statistics:
  # This task computes statistics on the prepared dataset. Its purpose is to get a high-level
  # idea of what is contained inside the data, without providing any specifics of any single entry
    parameters:
      inputs: {
        data_path: data/,                # Required. Value should be the output of the prepare task
        parameters_file: parameters.yaml # Required. Value must be `parameters.yaml`
      }
      outputs: {
        output_path: {
          type: file, default: statistics.yaml # Required. Value must be `statistics.yaml`
        }
