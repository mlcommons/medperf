#### project/Dockerfile
MLCubes rely on containers to work. By default, Medperf provides a functional Dockerfile, which uses `ubuntu:18.0.4` and `python3.6`. This Dockerfile handles all the required procedures to install your project and redirect commands to the `project/mlcube.py` file. You can modify as you see fit, as long as the entry point behaves as a CLI, as described before.
