This is merely a toy example to demonstrate MedPerf's capabilities of running Encrypted Containers.
The `container_config.yaml` file in this directory points to an encrypted form of the container found in the `../model_custom_cnn` directory.
The key to decrypt this container is also available right in this subdirectory as the `key.bin` file.
The encrypted archive file and the key are generated by following the instructions at `medperf/scripts/encrypt_container`.
