The MedPerf server registers an MLCube as metadata of a set of files that can be retrieved from the internet. This means before submitting an MLCube we need to host its files on the internet. The MedPerf client comes with a utility that can be used to prepare the files of an MLCube that need to be hosted. We refer you to [this page](/concepts/mlcube_files) if you want to understand what the files are and to explore all possible cases of what files an MLCube can be identified by, but using the utility script is enough.
