## Before We Start

#### Seed the server

For the purpose of the tutorial, you have to start with a fresh server database and seed it to create necessary entities that you will be interacting with. Run the following: (make sure you are in MedPerf's root folder)

```bash
cd server
sh reset_db.sh
python seed.py --cert cert.crt --demo {{page.meta.tutorial_id}}
```

#### Download the Necessary files

We provide a script that downloads necessary files so that you follow the tutorial smoothly. Run the following: (make sure you are in MedPerf's root folder)

```bash
sh tutorials_scripts/setup_{{page.meta.tutorial_id}}_tutorial.sh
```

This will create a workspace folder `medperf_tutorial` where all necessary files are downloaded.

#### Login to the Local Server

You credentials in this tutorial will be a username: `test{{page.meta.tutorial_id}}owner` and a password: `test`. Run:

```bash
medperf login
```

You will be prompted to enter your credentials.

You are now ready to start!
