# This workflow runs inside a github actions docker container. The workflow
# itself runs another docker container for hosting the dev server which is
# configured with some specific configurations (container network, port...)
# so that it works properly within the docker-in-docker setup. Keep in mind
# that github actions mounts the docker daemon path when running the
# workflow container.
#
# ******** NOTE ********
# MLCubes use docker behind the scenes by default. We don't have direct
# control over how docker commands are called by the MLCube, so care
# should be taken when we start using new container configurations
# inside the mlcube (e.g. networking)
