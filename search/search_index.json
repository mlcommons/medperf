For this tutorial, you can take a look at the implementation in the following folder: <code>medperf_tutorial/model_custom_cnn</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Metrics Container: Evaluates model performance by comparing models predictions to the data ground truth labels. For this tutorial, the metrics container will calculate Accuracy and AUC metrics.

When registering a container in MedPerf, you will be registering only metadata about the container. Other than providing a name to the container, you will be registering the following information for each container:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A pointer to the container configuration file: This file describes how the container will be run. It includes a pointer to the docker image for docker-based containers, a pointer for the singularity image for singularity-based containers, and a list of volume mounts for the container. The MedPerf client, during runtime, will read the config file to pull the container image, and to also know what volumes to mount to the container.</p> </li> <li> <p>A pointer to the container parameters file: This file is optional; it is only required if you build your container in a way such that it expects a mounted parameters file. This is usually helpful in cases where you don't want to hardcode application-specific parameters inside the container. Most of the tutorial containers will have a parameters file.</p> </li> <li> <p>A pointer to the container \"additional files\" compressed file: Similar to the parameters file, this file is optional; it is only required if you build your container in a way such that it expects a mounted folder for some additional files such as model weights.
