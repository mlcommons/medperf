tasks:
  prepare:
  # This task is in charge of transforming the input data into the format expected by the model cubes. 
    parameters:
      inputs: {
        data_path: {type: directory, default: data},  # Value must point to a directory containing the raw data inside workspace
        labels_path: {type: directory, default: data},  # Not used in this example
        parameters_file: parameters.yaml  # Not used in this example
      }
      outputs: {
        output_path: prepped_data/,  # Indicates where to store the transformed data. Must contain prepared data
        output_labels_path: labels/  # Indicates where to store the transformed data. Must contain labels
      }
  sanity_check:
  # This task ensures that the previously transformed data was transformed correctly.
  # It runs a set of tests that check que quality of the data. The rigurosity of those
  # tests is determined by the cube author.
    parameters:
      inputs: {
        data_path: {type: directory, default: prepped_data},  # Value should be the first output of the prepare task
        labels_path: labels/,  # Value should be the second output of the prepare task
        parameters_file: parameters.yaml  # Not used in this example
      }
  statistics:
  # This task computes statistics on the prepared dataset. Its purpose is to get a high-level
  # idea of what is contained inside the data, without providing any specifics of any single entry
    parameters:
      inputs: {
        data_path: {type: directory, default: prepped_data},  # Value should be the first output of the prepare task
        labels_path: labels/,  # Value should be the second output of the prepare task
