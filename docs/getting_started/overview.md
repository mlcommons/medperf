# Overview

The MedPerf client provides all the necessary tools to run a complete benchmark experiment. Below, you will find a comprehensive breakdown of user roles and the corresponding functionalities they can access and perform using the MedPerf client:

- **Benchmark Committee:** The [Benchmark Commitee](../roles.md#benchmark-committee) can define and create a benchmark, as well as manage experiments (e.g., approving which datasets and models will be allowed to participate)
- **Model Owner:** The [Model Owner](../roles.md#model-owners) can submit a model to the MedPerf server and request participation in a benchmark.
- **Data Owner:** The [Data Owner](../roles.md#data-providers) can prepare their raw medical data, register the **metadata** of their prepared dataset, request participation in a benchmark, execute a benchmark's models on their data, and submit the results of the execution.
