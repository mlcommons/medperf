## Tarball RANO Subject Browser

Below you may find the subjects identified within the passed tarball file.
You can review and annotate each case by using the `Review Tumor Segmentation`
button. This button will open ITK SNAP with the provided segmentation file.
You can make changes and save them as necessary. Once you're done with a
subject review, press the `Finalize`button.

In the case where skull stripping was not done correctly you can instead
modify the brain mask by pressing `Review Brain Mask`. This will open the
brain mask with ITK SNAP. Once you're done modifying the brain mask you
can save your progress and close the editor.

**NOTE**: Modifying the brain mask invalidates the tumor segmentation
for that subject.

Once you're done reviewing all cases, you can package them again into a
tarball file by pressing the `Package cases` button. You can then move
this new tarball file to the remote location where you're running the
rano-monitor tool.
