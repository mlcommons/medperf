## Hello World task
To provide a basic example of how Medperf MLCubes work under the hood, we provide a toy Hello World benchmark. This benchmark implements a pipeline for ingesting people's names, and generating greetings for those names given some criteria. Although this is not the most scientific example, it provides a clear idea of all the pieces that are required to implement your own MLCubes for Medperf.
